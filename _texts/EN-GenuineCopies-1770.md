## LETTER I.

My dear ----

I could not have imagined that the mistake of the millener’s girl would have occasioned such a *fracas* between me and your r---- h----. I am insensible to every other wish than that of gratifying the desires of a man whom I adore. To-morrow, at four o’clock, I shall be at —-’s in Sackville-street, where I shall wait, with the utmost impatience, the honour of seeing you. Harriot will be as faithful as she is assiduous. Perhaps I am imprudent in signing myself, what, however, I cannot avoid,

Your’s everlastingly,

—G—

[2]
## LETTER II.
My charming angel,

By a horrid mistake, which I will hereafter explain, 1 did not receive the last favour, till half an hour after the appointed hour of meeting; but unwilling to lose even the chance of an opportunity of testifying my attachment, I lost not a moment in repairing to ——’s, from whence you had been retired some minutes. I was hardy enough to follow you to —— Square, and should even have entered your house, but that I saw his lordship, with three of his friends, advancing immediately before me. Prudence therefore forbad that gratification which love had otherwise demanded. To-morrow, at six o’clock, you will find captain —— at that side of Buckingham gate next Chelsea. You know the rest; but you do not know how sincerely I am

Your ladyship’s most obedient,

Most devoted and most faithful humble Servant,

C—-

[3]
## LETTER III.

Alas Madam ! what shall I say! l am not less enraptured with your person, than charmed with your punctuality. The mistake was a horrid one! and the fault was all my own; instead of Buckingham gate, I should have written Constitution hill: Will you, can you, pardon me ? I have nothing to offer, in mitigation of my crime, but that, transported with the enchanting idea of clasping you in my arms, I could not write like a man in his senses. I will be at Drury-lane this evening, and, if you are not too much irritated, shall see you in the usual part of the house. Forgive me, if possible.

C——

[4]
## LETTER IV.
My chagrin, Sir, at not finding the captain at the place mentioned in your letter, can be equalled by nothing but that which I experienced, when I found you did not come to the play neither. Indeed, Sir, I am not to be thus trifled with; my Spirit revolts at the idea ; and though I would have preferred a cottage with you, to a palace with any other person, yet your
r—— h—— may be assured, that I shall not hastily subject myself to similar insults to those lately experienced by

G——

[5]
## LETTER V.
Most incomparable woman!

Believe me when I say that the first mistake ought to be forgiven, and that the second must be so — Love will plead my excuse in the first instance, for it took away my faculties — and Duty is my second plea. At the instant I was preparing for the Theatre, I received orders which I could not disobey. My trusty —— was absent, so that I had not even an opportunity of acquainting you with the circumstance. To-night, at nine o’clock, whatever be the consequence, you shall see me at Mrs. ———’s, in ——— street; and I hope you will then ratify the pardon of

Your ladyship’s most profound,
most devoted admirer,

C-------

## CARD.
I own I am properly treated. Your ladyship had a right to be revenged. I acknowledge the justice of the chastisement.

[6]

## LETTER VI.
My dear,

If you please we will agree on a suspension of hostilities. I am revenged, I am satisfied. The waiting-woman has well performed her part. Your r—— h—— will for the future be more cautious, and perhaps your future assignations may not be followed by any neglect on the part of

Your very sincere —

—-G—.

## CARD.
An accident, which cannot at present be explained, prevents my having the
honour of seeing your r—— h—— this afternoon. The bearer will acquaint you with particulars.

[7]
## LETTER VII.
My angel!

Excuse me if, in the extravagance of my joy, I thank you again and again for the favours of last night. Oh! my —-! a man must think as I think, love as I love, and feel as exquisitely as I feel, ere he can be sufficiently grateful for obligations, which, though they will be always remembered, can never be repaid, by

Your ladyship’s most obedient,
And sincerely devoted,

C——;

[8]
## LETTER VIII.

Sir,

It is now three weeks since I have had a line from your hands, and should be unable to judge whether you were or not in the land of the living, but from the public prints. I suppose Portsmouth and its environs have so many charms, that I shall not soon have the honour of complimenting your trusty valet with the least mark of my attachment to his master. I had news to tell you, but I must wait till the wind changes.

Yours, ,

as I ought to be,

——G——.

[9]
## LETTER IX.

Madam,

Your last cruel letter found me on the point of taking post-chaise for London, where I am no sooner arrived, than I sit down to assure you that my sentiments are wholly unchanged; that I am incapable of change, and that, if you have not heard from me as frequently as usual, it ought not to be attributed to any alteration in my sentiments, but to a sense of the importance of the commission with which I was charged, which would not admit of my thinking a moment on any other subject. Excuse this freedom, madam, in an Englishman and a subject. Tomorrow, if you please, at eleven o’ clock, I will have the honour of throwing myself at your feet in —— street; and of this my intention I will immediately apprize Mrs.—-, that she may be prepared for our reception.

Yours, more than his own, '

C——

[Two or three letters appear to be wanting in this place.]

[10]
—in ——shire, Oct. 30.
I had scarcely prevailed on myself to hear the consolations which my woman offered on the misery of my being dragg’d to this place, when I received your r—- h—-s’s letter by the hands of the landlord of the Red-lion, who, I believe, is a man that may be trusted. To prevent, however, all possibility of any accident which might happen from your letters being conveyed through this channel, I beg that in future, your r—— h—— will direct “To Miss Anne Robinson, to be left at the post-office in ——, ‘till called for.” By this means all search will be eluded, and every attempt towards a discovery be rendered wholly fruitless. The clergyman whom you recommended to my lord is greatly in favour, and I am in hopes that his reverence may be made useful.

Yours, yours truly.

N. B. The above letter has no subscription.

[11]
## LETTER XI
My sweet angel!

It is not in the power of language to express the ardent desire I have of prostrating myself at your feet. Every moment of your absence I esteem an age; and if your brute of a lord does not soon take the resolution of coming to London, I shall certainly take that of visiting your seat in the country. Your ladyship would think this an impolitick step, but be not alarmed: if it should be necessary, depend on my prudence and management for finding an excuse for the visit, which might pass on a wiser man than your lord, — curse on the word! I am tormented to think that there should be any legal obstruction to the full gratification of our wishes: for I am, with the sincerest, most ardent, and most persevering passion,

Your truly affectionate,

truly devoted servant,

——C——

[12]
## CARD
Tuesday morning, 10 o’clock.

We arrived in London late last night, and I have stolen this opportunity of acquainting you, that the person in the blue and scarlet livery will be in the Park precisely at four this afternoon. You know the rest.

## CARD.

Eleven o’ clock.

I will not fail to be at the old place at four o’ clock; but as I shall have company, direct the bearer of your favour to be careful in the delivery.

[13]
## LETTER XII.
Angelic woman!

What shall I say!! How shall I enough acknowledge the communication of the last important secret! And is he such a brute ? Then my hopes are almost realized; and lady F—— will not long scruple to make one in our little parties of pleasure. For prudential reasons, I now write the fictitious hand, and direct accordingly, without subscribing this letter.

[14]
## LETTER XIII.
My good fortune, Sir, has prevented a most fatal accident: your last letter fell into his lordship’s hand, and he communicated it to my mother; who had no sooner read it, than, with a prudence and foresight peculiar to herself, She told his lordship that it was certainly intended for one of the servant-maids; with which excuse he seemed contented, and departed. My mama immediately sent for me, and taxed me with infidelity, but, at the same time, promised that she would discover nothing, if I would vow an eternal reformation. You may be certain I did not hesitate. But, for the sake of all that is dear to me in this world, be cautious in future. I will be in —— street at twelve to-morrow precisely. Sally will tell you the reason of my being able to make this appointment.

Your own,

G——.

[15]
## LETTER XIV.

My dear madam,	Tuesday noon.

If I could not have the happiness of seeing you yesterday, it must not be attributed to any designed neglect on my part, but to the indispensible obligation I was under of attending a council, which was held precisely at the hour which you were obliging enough to fix on, and of which I had not ten minutes previous notice.——***** ****——If you can make it convenient to be at the Star and Garter at Chelsea, to-morrow, at four o’clock, you will most assuredly find me there; but if any thing should happen to prevent your attendance, you may be assured that I shall put the most favourable construction on the matter, and regretting only the loss of your sweet company, think nothing of the time I may spend there in the hope of enjoying it, for I am, madam, with the most perfect and inviolable attachment,

eternally your’s,

C——

[16]
## LETTER XV.

Wednesday —-

Dearest of creatures!

The favour of your company yesterday I ought to acknowledge with the most sincere gratitude. I do acknowledge it; and I recal the idea of the happy moments we passed together, with a rapture which none but the most sincere of lovers can be capable of feeling. I know your engagements for this evening; and you know the prudential reasons which prevent my being at the same place. To-morrow at six o’clock, I am engaged with you know whom, to go to Woolwich, to see the launch of the newsSeventy-four gun strip. Alas! I had rather be witness to a launch of another kind. Pardon me, my dear lady, you know the sincerity of my attachment, and I need not tell you that I am,

unalterably your’s,

C——

[17]

## CARD.
Yesterday was a day of perfect debauchery. Alas! what a contrast did it afford to the moments of rapture! At ten o’clock this evening, my trusty fellow will be at your ladyship’s door, and conduct you, with all proper precaution, to my arms. I know how his lordship has engaged himself; so that you have nothing to fear.

## LETTER XVI.

My dear Sir!

Allow me to call you by that tender name, since our acquaintance now is, or ought to be, established on so firm a basis, as to banish all distinctions. You know how dear you are to me: you know also, that it is time for me to consider myself as one who has some claim to your affectionate regard. Indeed I have no doubt but I am beloved by you; and, in this confidence, I have bad adieu to all those considerations which would have had weight

[18]

with the majority of my sex. It is not probable that I shall have the happiness of your company for six weeks at least; oh! what a tedious time ! we are going to our seat in ——shire, from whence, I believe, we shall not return till after the Christmas holidays. If any method could be devised, by which I could safely correspond with you, it would be some alleviation to the distress which I must suffer by my absence from the man whom I hold most dear; from the man who is indeed the prince of my affections.

G——

## LETTER XVII.

Angel of a woman!

Your last obliging letter has at once given me more pain, and afforded me more satisfaction, than all the preceding. The thought of losing you for six weeks torments me beyond description, while the assurance you give of the sincerity and constancy of your regard, serves as a healing balm to the wound. I flatter myself that [19]
there will be no difficulty in our maintaining a correspondence, that shall not be even
subject to suspicion. The village of ———— is within two miles of your seat; the landlord of the White Bear at that place was formerly in the sea service; and he now enjoys the benefit of half pay through my mediation; so that he is devoted to my service, and I will instantly take such measures, that your letters may be safely left with him, and will engage that he shall deliver mine in return into the hands of the faithful girl whom your ladyship has So often trusted. But I flatter myself that a mutual correspondence will not be all. I
can easily steal to ———— in the depth of the night; and if your ladyship can prevail on yourself to walk, unattended, to that village, I see no reason why I may not have the happiness of throwing myself at your feet any morning, when his lordship is engaged with a hunting party. Think of this scheme, and favour me with an answer before you leave London.——In all events believe me, unchangeably your’s,

C——

[20]

## CARD.
I have just received your ———’s letter.

I thank you for the hint; the place is not more than a mile from the extremity of the Park; I can easily steal thither; his ————p hunts Tuesdays and Saturdays; take your measures accordingly.

## LETTER XVIII.

———square, Sunday night.

May it please your——

I beg pardon, my dear friend, I was going to begin in the fulsome stile of petitions. I must acknowledge that you are an adept in scheming. Who would have imagined that a six weeks intrigue, and in the country too, could have been carried on with so much secrecy, that not even a single servant in the family should become acquainted with it? We arrived in town yesterday, and had scarce received cards of compliment from half our acquaintance, when my lord informed me that he was [21] under an immediate necessity of going into Devonshire, in consequence of advice that he has received of the sudden illness of an intimate friend, from whom he has considerable expectations. He will set out this very evening, so that there will be no obstruction to our meeting. You may give the bearer your answer with safety. Alas!

I find myself too much,

your very humble servant,

G———

## CARD.
Indeed, my angel, humble servant is a phrase much too cold; but I will see you at eleven o’clock, when I hope to inspire you with sentiments more warm and favourable to the man who would chearfully resign every thing that is dear to him, to call you his own for ever.

[22]
## LETTER XIX.

Dearest of women! Thursday, Three o’clock.

A strange accident befell me soon after five o' clock this morning, when I left your house. I had scarcely pass’d the end of ——— street, when I met capt. ****, and a blade of his acquaintance, in a most exquisite trim. They had poured down such repeated libations to Bacchus, that neither of them was able to keep his legs. In this humour they insisted on my accompanying them to the ——— tavern, and, pleased with the preceding part of the night, I could not refuse them. Forgetting my rank therefore, I suffered myself to be prevailed on; and ——I blush to tell you the rest. It was eleven o’ clock this morning before I got to rest, and am now only risen to inform you that I am so ill as to deprive me of the honour of seeing you this evening. I trust to your ladyship’s goodness to excuse me, and wait your farther orders; for I am, and always will be.

Most sincerely yours,

C——

[23]
## LETTER XX.

My dear Duke, Thursday, 7 o’ clock.

I have you know, by your permission, a right to use the above familiar phrase. Ha! ha! ha! I cannot but laugh at your last night’s adventure. The very captain who encountered your ——— was formerly a suitor to your humble servant. Oh the beast ! You could not have met with a more contemptible companion. But seriously, Sir, I shall be at the obliging lady ———’s at three to-morrow. You know her ladyship dines early——If you can make any pretence to become one of the party, you may be certain how agreeable it will be to

Your truly affectionate,

G——.

[24]
## LETTER XXI.
It is an age, my charmer, since I had the honour of a note from your fair hand; and I know not what cruel destiny it is, that will deprive me of a sight of your dear person for some time longer. I must repair to Portsmouth to-morrow.—— Would to heaven your seat lay in the road to that place. But I must submit to my fate, and since I cannot have the honour of taking a personal leave of you, must beg you will accept my warmest wishes, and all possible assurance, that I will be ever

Yours,

C———.

## CARD.
I have just received your —— ——s’s last favour. You are going to Portsmouth to-morrow, I to ——-shire. Farewell, till I see or hear from you again.

[25]

## LETTER XXII.

Most lovely of women !

I am this instant returned from Portsmouth, where I hope I have performed my duty as became a good subject and an officer; nor could I let a moment pass before I acquainted you with my arrival. I know it is possible some disagreeable consequences may arise from dispatching this to your country-feat: but true love braves all dangers. If you receive this letter safe, we have nothing to fear; but, lest it should happen otherwise, I have written in the fictitious hand.

## LETTER XXIII.

Oh my dear Sir !

I still tremble through the apprehensions of what might have been the consequence of your sending your last letter in so unguarded a manner. If my lord had been at home, I had been ruined, fortunately he was not; but, for heaven’s sake, never make an attempt of this kind again.

[26]
I have now good news for you; we shall leave this place for London on Friday next; I shall be at St. Alban’s on Saturday Evening, attended only by ——— and ———. I suppose I need say no more to a cavalier of your spirit and resolution. I propose to put up at the sign of the ——: but if you do not find me there, you know the other house. If no misfortune be the consequence of this meeting, I shall flatter myself that all danger is at an end, and that I may meet the man I love with less fearful apprehensions than have lately fallen to the share of

Your most truly enamoured,

G——.

## LETTER XXIV.
I congratulate you, my charming girl, and I most sincerely congratulate myself, on the prospect before us. I will not fail to be at St. Alban’s at the moment of assignation; and be assured that I will elude the search of every other eye. Permit me to anticipate my happiness.

Yours, wholly yours,

C——.

[27]

## CARD.

Alas my princess! the adventure of St. Alban’s will never be erazed from my mind. Keep up your spirits, I beseech you, and let not this accident rob you of your peace. All will be well: you cannot be more chagrined than I am: but you may be assured of the exertion of my best abilities, and the influence of all my power, and that of my friends, to prevent any fatal consequences arising from the detection.

## LETTER XXV.

My dear Sir,

Pardon the tenderness of the expression, you are now dearer to me than ever. Your card, which was brought me by my faithful girl, gave some relief to a heart almost overwhelmed with its sorrows. I am quite sunk, quite dejected in spirits, and, from what I can judge of his
[28]
lordship’s disposition, I dare say he will carry matters to extremities. Let me hear from you frequently, I beseech you, as that will be all the consolation I can at present expect. I shall remove to-morrow to the new lodging in ——street, where I shall hope for the favour of your next letter.

Adieu!——the inconsoleable

——G——.

## LETTER XXVII.

My sweet girl,

Have patience under your afflictions, I beseech you all will yet be well; I have already taken measures to pacify his ———, and I have not a doubt but I shall succeed. Is there no method to be taken by which I could have the happiness of an interview with you? Perhaps we might, when together, concert some scheme, by which at once to extricate ourselves from the present difficulties: at least it would be some consolation to confer together on the
[29]
source of our misfortunes. Let me have an answer as soon as possible. I am, my dear G——-, yours,

C——

## LETTER XXVII.

O my dear and thrice dear *****!

I have but this moment received your letter, and cannot lose a moment in answering it. For heaven's sake think not of visiting me, for I am so closely watched	by his ————p’s agents, that such a step must needs be attended with the most fatal consequences. Abandon the thought therefore, I beseech you, and let not the wish to see me at present deprive me of the happiness of your company for ever.

Adieu.

Yours only,

G————.

[30]
## LETTER XXVIII.
I yield, madam, to the injunctions contained in your last letter, though in so doing I offer the utmost violence to my own inclinations: besides, I cannot be wholly of your opinion: though a disguise has once failed us, it might not always do so; but I submit implicitly to your will, and as I cannot have, for the present, the honour of kneeling at your feet, I will make a short tour to Portsmouth, and parts adjacent, to try if travelling, and a perpetual succession of new objects, will console me, in any degree, for the loss of your company. But alas! I foresee the attempt will be vain, and that your dear image will haunt me whereever I go. To-morrow, before break of day, I will set off, and hope, at my return, to hear good news from my angel. I will not be absent more than a week, and if, in the mean time, you should have any thing to communicate, deliver your packet to my trusty *****, to whom I have given instructions where to find me
[31]
in every part of my tour. Adieu, my angel! Adieu for a week! Alas! it is a million of ages to one who loves like

Your own ——

C————

## CARD.
I am just arrived; what’s the news? I could learn nothing concerning you during my absence, except what came through the channel of the public prints; and in circumstances like ours, you know how little they are to be depended on. Expedite your answer, for I am in tortures till I receive it.

## CARD.
[32]

I have great news to tell you; but they must be the subject of a letter, which shall be ready against the evening. I will direct it to Mr. ———— to be left at the ——— coffee house ——cross.

## LETTER XXIX.

My dear ——

The day after you left London, I received authentic intelligence that his lordship had determined to litigate the affair in ———— Commons. I knew not what step to take, and therefore patiently submitted to my fate. I knew that a week would make very little difference in an affair, which the gentlemen of the robe were to be concerned in; and therefore did not trouble you with any letter during your absence, unwilling as I was to disturb that repose which I hoped you would enjoy in the course of your tour. I hope it has not
[33]
been a disagreeable one, and that you are returned in perfect health to London. I just now learn that his ———p is resolved to carry matters to the utmost extremity, and to take every advantage that the laws will afford him. In this conjuncture, therefore, I beg your advice, by which I will be wholly guided. I think it would not be prudent for you to attempt teeing me, or to send any more letters, except a final one, how you intend to act in this critical emergency.

I am,

with the warmest attachment,

unalterably yours,

——G————.

[34]
## LETTER XXX.

My angel!

Since his ————p is for a legal submission, we must submit; and we will see him out with resolution. He is determined to try the merits of the cause; be it so; the trial shall be attended with sufficient expence, and every chicanery which the law will admit of shall be put in force against him. Who knows, my charmer, we may yet come off conquerors: but be that as it will, we will riot in pleasures for the remainder of our lives. Favour me with a flight note, intimating that you have received this letter; and here let our correspondence drop for the present.

Yours everlastingly,

C———.

[35]
## CARD.
I have the favour of your ——s’s last. I applaud your spirit, and I will endeavour to wait with chearfulness the event of the matter.

FINIS.
