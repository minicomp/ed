- DELAYED till she had ceased to know,
- Delayed till in its vest of snow
- {:.indent-2}Her loving bosom lay.
- An hour behind the fleeting breath,
- Later by just an hour than death,—
- {:.indent-2}Oh, lagging yesterday!


- Could she have guessed that it would be;
- Could but a crier of the glee	
- {:.indent-2}Have climbed the distant hill;
- Had not the bliss so slow a pace,—
- Who knows but this surrendered face
- {:.indent-2}Were undefeated still?


- Oh, if there may departing be
- Any forgot by victory
- {:.indent-2}In her imperial round,
- Show them this meek apparelled thing,
- That could not stop to be a king,
- {:.indent-2}Doubtful if it be crowned!
