## LETTER I.

John Rambler, Esq; to Sir Francis Crosley.

Though I have told thee twenty times, dear Francis, that to women I am indebted for the good qualities thou praisest in me, thou still perseverest in thy incredulity - Why dost thou not believe me?

- "Experience has taught thee that the fair may make a vicious, but never a virtuous man." - Thy experience proves only thou hast sacrificed thy taste, delicacy, and reason, to the want of thy senses. Were I to conclude from lord S-w-h's irreligion and
contempt of honour, that every lord is the scandal and the disgrace of the nation, wonldst thou take my word? A few profligate fellows and libertine women are not the satire of mankind. Weeds, Francis, will sometimes grow among the lilies and roses — a sir James L----- will be seen with a duke of
Portland.; a lady Gr-----r with a dutchess of Buccleugh; but be certain, that nature is as much asleep when she creates such a baronet and vicountess, as the gardener is inattentive when he suffers a nettle to exist near the most beautiful flowers, which adorn our gardens.

Who would not laugh at me, did I look for *wit* or *humour* at the *beef-stake-club* for *disinterestedness* or *honour* at *Arthur's,* for *pleasure* or *discretion* at Mrs. *Cornely's?*  This is thy case, Francis, and yet thou art unconscious of it.
In the purlieus of Covent-Garden, thou went in search of modesty and virtue, and as thou didst not find them there, thou reason’dst thy self into the belief of their non-existence. Tell me not, that thy opinion is formed from this or that woman being daily pointed out to the censure of the public; those reports, calumny propogates: for one really guilty, thousands are innocent. Thou hast no faith in the patriotism of Wilkes, and the abilities of lord North. - Are not that patriotism, and those abilities as publicly sworn to as the indiscreet
behaviour of this or that woman? Thy partiality is an affront to thy understanding, and the goodness of thy heart. - Either credit every report, or declare for or against them, only, when thou mayest pronounce without the fear of an appeal to the tribunal of another man’s judgement. Thou despisest women indeed, if thou thinkest they do not deserve the exertion of thy reason more than a Wilkes or a North. - Say it not - never say it, Francis, lest an enemy should catch the word, and mark
thee for the Scorn of the sensible.

Thy conquest over three married women is no argument in thy favour, of the three thou seducest, two might be justified - the third, thou hast too much pride ever to boast of.

A merchant is, through unexpected misfortunes, ready to fail - his wife to save him from misery and the infamy of turning bankrupt, yielded to thy passion. - Who will call her foible libertinism? - Love gave thee the I'ady of an officer, who was as odious as thou wast amiable - Love! though I cannot excuse - indeed,, indeed, I will not condemn her. - Lady V--e! - Could she refuse thee, she, who denied nobody? -  

Women of rank, fortune, or good education, dear Francis, have generosity, virtue, sincerity and candour; frequent their company, and thou shalt agree with me, it is the sole school where young men can improve their mind, and correct the defects of nature.

To that School I owe the esteem of the world; had it not been for it, I should probably be below their contempt.
Adieu.

London 1770.

## LETTER II.

Sir Francis Crosley, to John Rambler, Esq.

My reason is proof againss words, Jack. Either cease to maintain that women are virtuous, or illustrate thy assertion with facts. Name me some beauties, who having loved, have triumphed over their own desires, and the attacks of their lovers - then - then only, will I believe thee.

Bath 1770.

## LETTER III

John Rambler, Esq; to Sir Francis Crosley.

I will comply with thy desire, Francis, and talk to thy Reason the sole anguage she will understand - the language of facts. The history of my life will convince thee of thy error — if, after having read it, thou shamelessly continuest an unbeliever, thou deservest the fate of Orpheus. Upon my honour I would not deliver thee from the Sury of a sex thou traducest so wantonly,
Iwere it in my power to secure thee against their revenge. Let justice, virtue thou scrupulously obeyest in thy intercourse with men, create thy esteem or contempt of women. - If some swerve voluntarily from their duty, despise them, thou hast my leave - But, for a few nature betrayest into guilt, is it just to impeach the innocence of millions? - The trials I have made, authorise me to charge thee with a want of equity - formed to please, I have been loved - Francis! though I always seized
every opportunity chance, art, or passion gave me - though the victim lay often panting in my arms, ready for the sacrifice - though her heart beat for a mutual bliss, virtue constantly intervened, and robed me of victory. Had I had the savage indelicacy of a rake, I might have succeeded - But I was a man, and not a monster. My testimony is the more decisive in favour
of women, that having been early taught to contemn them, I could not have so easily shaken off the prejudices I had imbibed in the spring of my life against them, had they not forcibly made me conscious of my folly and their worthiness. The prepossessions of youth cannot be destroyed but by time, and a concatenation of happy circumstances: through the want of the latter, many live and die in the errors they mistook for truth, when their reason in its infancy could not discern between right and wrong. We were told, thou and I, at Oxford, that female virtue was a chimera: the levity and falsehood of women, were the constant topic, of all our leisure hours - Like enthusiasts
believed without knowing the motives of our credulity. Rich and independant, thou followedst fashion, and pantedst after easy pleasures. - A Society of a cast similar to thy own, finished the work of a bad education, and printed on thy mind thy opinion of women, with an indelible die. Fortune obliged me to overrun a carreer different from thine - By her caprice I was placed in situations, which made me sensible of my injustice - I necessarily became the advocate of a sex thou lovest and despisest. - The incidents which caused that alteration in me, I
will relate in my next. Adieu.

## LETTER IV

Thou hadst not ledt Oxford three months, when a letter I received from my father, plunged me into real misery, and from the happiest of the thoughtless Oxonians, made me the most anxious of all the rational beings. The loss of two ships richly loaded, which had been taken by a French privateer off Cape Finisterre, reduced him to the utmost indigence. -  He had but time to write the fatal news, as the fear of his creditors compelled him to fly immediately to Holland. — “I have
no money to send you, added he, nor can I provide for your futuresSupport - you have knowledge and wit - there are opulent fools in England - your fate is in your own hand; it will be your fault if it is unhappy. - Please or be useful, if you possess either of those advantages you need no other - without them, be ever so virtuous or learned, you shall languish your life away, the scorn of mankind.” -

Had my father’s advice been accompanied by a purse of gold, I might have ventured to London in search of the fools he Spoke of. - But poor and friendless - be not angry Francis; I know
I thou wouldst have taken me to thy bosom, and made me share in thy wealth, had I acquainted thee with my distress. - In the first flutter of my spirits, I did not think of thee, and when friendship revived thee in my memory, love struck me silent.

Pride suffering me not to stay at Oxford till my disaster should mark me out an object of pity, I set off the next day on foot for London. The natural carelessness of my temper dissipated gradually the gloomy thoughts which had crowded into my mind; I laughed at an evil which it was not in my power to avoid. Hope and philosophy supported my courage, and spread flowers upon the road I walked. The third day of my journey, as I was crossing Hyde-park, I saw at some distance a throng of men and horses.  Asking for the cause, I was told it was a sale of some of the most beautiful hunters in England. Thou knowest Francis, that I have studied horses more than Greek and Latin, and that I was renowned for my knowledge of their beauties and defects. Curiosity brought me to the place, where, at the first sight, I could not help admiring the hunters. They had such a form, such a life, as made me envy a noble lord who intended to purchase them. The affectation of the jockey, in keeping unnecessarily the horses in a perpetual movement, made me suspicious. I observed with the eye of self interest, and soon discovered a weakness in the left hinder leg of one of the hunters, which the art of his rider had secreted from the spectators. Angry at the deceit, the villain designed to put upon the nobleman, I drew nearer his lordship, and when he offered three hundred guineas for the lame hunter, I cried aloud, that the horse was not worth forty. Not worth orty! exclaimed almost every person present; and they looked upon me with the supercilious smile of contempt. No, not worth forty, answered I boldly. The horse courser, damning me and my judgement, desired some of his friends to duck me in the Serpentine river. His desire they cheerfully undertook to gratify. I was nigh being the victim of my honesty, when
lord C-----, who in the mean time had perused me from head to foot, humanely interposed in my favour, and saved me from the rage of the disappointed sharpers. His lordship took me apart. “Who are you?” - unwilling to let him know what I had been, I told him, that having lately lost my master at Oxford, I was going to London in search of a place. "What imperfection have you observed in that horse?" - I whispered the discovery I
had made, and begged his lordship's protection. Lord C ----- turned to the jockey, and ordered him to dismount. The unwillingness of the fellow to obey provoked his lordship, who charged his master with an intention to cheat him. The horse is lame, said lord C ----- to the spectators. Suppose he is, answered the master, with an unspeakable assurance, must I tell it you? - My business is to sell; yours is to know what you buy. Were it not for lucky casualties, who would undergo the fatigues of my trade whatever, and be the slave of he public? Though his lordship seemed to be contented with that apology, the spectators resented it with an honest anger. They all to a man fell upon the horse courser and his friends and chastised them severely for their impudence. After lord C ----- had for a few minutes feasted his indignation with the punishment deservedly inflicted upon the scoundrels, he thanked me for the service I had done him, and bid a servant to shew me the way to his house.

---

## LETTER V

As soon as I came to lord C-----'s he sent for me.

“Your figure, skill and honesty, Rambler, have prejudiced me in your favour. You want a place; till a better one offers itself, you are welcome to be my groom of the stable.” -

Considering the emptiness of my purse, and that many an individual had from a lower degree risen to opulence, through the interest of their patrons, I gratefully accepted the employment he gave me.

“I fancym,Rambler, said his worship with a smile, that twenty guineas will not hurt you in the situation you are. - Besides I owe you a reward, and it is just I should pay it." -

Ineed not tell thee, Francis, that I made no objection to his generosity. I pocketed the money, and immediately entered into office.

The sight and feeling of the twenty guineas, tempted me often to leave lord C -----’s service, and I know not what would have been the consequence of that perpetual temptation, had not my father’s letter occurred, to my mind. I had adopted the notion, that the man who prides in being just and grateful, was born to be the fool of an artful knave. - Lord C ----- was that man --  
that reflection determined me. I remained in the post fortune had placed me, and filled its duty with care, alacrity, and to the utmost satisfaction of his lordship.

I had not been three weeks in the house, before a favourite footman initiated me into the secret of his master's passions. Jealousy was the predominant in his heart. The countess was young, gay, handsome, and it was whispered abroad, she was not the most faithful of wives. I asked whether she had confirmed his lordship’s suspicions. - “We all sincerely believe, answered the footman, that she has not. From the coquettry of her carriage, and her love of dissipation only, he questions her virtue. Since that whim has entered his head, many are the dismal hours he passes alone in his closet, many the vexations the countess labours under.” - I am afraid he will at last force his lady to realise his fears, and deserve the opinion he unjustly entertains of her. - I know not for a wife a greater incentive to infidelity than the unjust suspicions of her husband - the charms of a lover have not, half their
power and seduction. - This reflection I kept to myself.

Sometime after we all set out for Elverton castle, a seat of his lordship’s in Lincolnshire.

Lord C ----- was extremely fond of horses, but like most of the nobility knew very little of that noble and useful animal. As he would however pass for a connoisseur, I proved him so effectually he was a perfect one, that I ngratiated myself into his affection. Every day my conversation pleasing him better, he resolved to take me from the stable to the antichamber.

“I love your person and wit, said he one day to me: Your merit is buried in the situation you are in; since I have discovered it, I will place you upon a stage where you may display it to advantage. My lady wants a gentleman; prepare yourself to act in that character; and be careful by your discretion and attachment, to deserve my future favours.”

I fell at his lordship’s feet, and swore to make myself worthy of the trust he reposed in me. My new post requiring some elegance in my dress, I became the next day, by the art of the taylor, a very smart well looking fellow, so Smart, that lady C-----’s waiting women, who, before, had not deigned to take any
notice of Jack, gazed upon master Rambler with a smile, and courted his friendship. My lady viewed me with a side glance, and, turning to her lord, muttered her approbation of the choice he had made.

No Servant in the family murmured at my promotion: Jack had been long their favourite; and as I had not the silly pride to forget what I had been, they all applauded the partiality of their master in my favour.

I had not been a week in my place, before I perceived that the countess looked upon me rather as a spy over her behaviour, than as a man devoted to her. She thought me the tool of her hushand’s jealousy, and accordingly treated me with a coolness I deserved not. I asked her waiting woman why I displeased when I was so studious of doing my duty. “I was wrong to complain; her ladyship did me justice; but she was not' used to be familiar with her people.” Those constant answers not satisfying me, I determined to argue the cafe with the countess herself.

One morning that her women were gone down to breakfast, her ladyship ringing the bell, I entered her apartment, and asked for her orders. —

“It is not you, sir, I want; be pleased to call one of my women up." -

And she stepped to her closet.

“Will you, my lady, condescend to hear a few minutes the most zealous of your servants?" -

“Who is he, sir?" -

"I, my lady." -

“You!” -

And she darted a piercing look at me.

“My lady, dismiss me from your service, or confide in me. - I cannot live with a sincere wish of pleasing you, and the certainty of being disliked. - My lord, it is true, gave me to you - But you only I serve and will obey - I beg on my knee, you will not mistrust my fidelity - Your doubt of it is a dagger to my heart. - Either dismiss me, or confide in me.” -

I was so moved while I spoke, that tears rushed out from my eyes. The tone of my voice, my situation, and the tears I forcibly shed, affected feelingly lady C-----. She saw sincerity in my countenance, and questioned not my word. She drew near me.

"Rise, sir; I am happy in believing you attached to me. I had my reasons to be fearful and diffident. - You have erased every suspicion from my breast. - There can be no hypocrisy in those tears - Your anxiety was too natural. From this moment I trust to you."

“You make me the happiest of men.” -

And I respectfully kissed the hand she tendered me.

“As a compensation for my past injuscice, and a token of my future esteem, take this.” -

She presented me a fifty pounds bank note. I pleaded in vain my disinterestedness; I was obliged to accept her generous gift.

"Let not my lord know the consideration 1 have for you. - He will soon convince you of the necessity of keeping it a secret.” -
I promised to be true to her - to obey her dictates, and execute her commands.

The joy I felt at having so happily succeeded, diffused itself through every feature, and gave a charm to my carriage, which attracted lady C-----’s attention. I had the very looks of a lover just reconciled to his mistress. -  Had her ladyship told me, “I love you,"" I would not have been a more living picture of happiness. The countess beheld me with an air of satisfaction, which my self-love had a mind to interpret for sentiment. When a handsome woman smiles upon you, who will not be tempted to think he is not indifferent? Fearful to offend, I dissembled the mistake I was inclined to make, and casting modestly my eyes down, waited in silence for her further commands.

“I love a feeling man, said the countess, with a smile. You have so ingenuously expressed your grief and joy, that I am certain you have a noble and generous heart. - Confirm me in the opinion I have formed of you.” -

"It will be my sole study, my lady.” -

"It will be mine to reward.” -

At that minute her waiting woman coming in, she reassumed her air of dignity, and with a nod bid me out of her room.

## LETTER VI

When I could, undisturbed, indulge a reverie upon my conversation with the countess, miy pride recollected carefully every word she spoke, every emotion she felt, which I might construe as a symptom of inclination in my favour. However impertinent my presumption, I did not attempt to check it. I was young, graceful, and of an athletic form; this last quality
was, in my opinion, superior to the advantage of a noble birth; and, I had heard that several ladies of quality, preferred it always to title, fortune, and merit. “Why should not lady C-----
be captivated by the same charm, which seduced so many others? Her youth bespeaks a want of pleasure, and her eyes, if my observation is just, are oftener enlivened by the fire of desire than deadned by the languor of indifference. - She hates her hushand." -

This last refieclion, dear Francis, animated my hopes; I resolved to neglect no occasion of pleasing, and to act in such a discreet manner, as to be sure of my pardon, before I should venture to offend. The fifty pounds, and the new conceit O entertained, cooled my gratitude for lord C-----. Vain, and  
having my fortune to make, integrity fled from my heart: I gave way to love and ambition.

In the presence of her women, the countess treated me with her usual coolness, but when they were absent she made amends for it with a most enchanting familiarity. I told her one day that the family thought me in disgrace with her ladyship.

“Certain of my esteem for you, Rambler, mind not what they say. Prudence dictates my conduct towards you." -

Here she paused and smothered a blush.

“When we come to understand one another, you know all know my motives, and approve of them. - Leave me, I have a letter to write. -

I was so taken up with the, “When we come to understand one another," that I did not hear the last words she spoke.

“What are you musing about, Rambler?” -

"About the real sense of what you have Said.” -

"Time will explain it.” -

“Time will not add to my attachment to you, my lady. - Put not off to another day the unfolding of that mystery - My heart pants after the knowledge of it. - Deign to Speak.” -

“I must not, I must not," answered she with a charming vivacity. And then she repeated, “leave me; I have a letter to write."

I obeyed, but with reluctancy, and not without turning often my head in the flattering expectation of being called back.

"Rambler!" -

"My lady!" -

A visible confusion upon her I did not call.

"I did not call." -

“I thought you did.” -

And I turned again to the door with a dejected air.

After this scene, dear Francis, was I too bold to think that I was loved? Had it not been for my discretion, would I have had the least doubt of it? Her rank awed me; I did not dare to say - nay to appear I did understand her. - Her reservedness belied her words. - Though she talked, her action did not encourage me. - Not once, had she given me an invitation to her lips. - Woman is so inextricable an animal, that though I thought I might
have safely sworn to the reality of her ladyship’s affection for me, yet I was at the same time apprehensive of indulging an error. This fear silenced my tongue, and made me trust to her to her own heart for the end of my perplexity.

"There are women, who, through delicacy or caprice, will favour their lovers only when their possession is the least expected: rest their solid and their own desires, who, at that very minute, contrive an opportunity to reconcile their pleasure with their modesty. - All have every day one hour, in which a sagacious and bold man, would complete their defeat. The indifferent will say the contrary: I believe them not. That hour is, I own, less sensibly marked with them, than with the tender women; but I am certain, that when love is absent, nature always presides." Thus, Francis, I thought, and therefore concluded I should be happy; but when, I had not the assurance to six. Thou wilt perhaps think that I was enamoured of the countess; if thou dost, thou art wrong. Lady C----- was so exquisitely beautiful, that it was impossible to breathe the same air without wishing to delirate in her arms: But if my senses longed for delights, my heart was as calm as that of an usurer intreated to lend money without premium and securities. The benefit resultihg from an intrigue with her, was the mobile of my behaviour; could I have got from her generosity, what I flattered myself to obtain from her tenderness, never would I have gone, with Spirit, through the fatigue of mimicking a real passion.

London 1771.

## LETTER VII.

I had not been gone an hour from the countess’s apartment, when my lord sent for me. I found him in the attitude of a man oppressed with grief. He, leaned against the back of a chair, and held a letter in his hand, which he seemed to read with indignation and fury.

“I am vexed, mortally vexed, Rambler, cried his lordship as soon as he saw me. The countess betrays me - do you know any man whom she receives oftener, or more privately than any other?" -

“Indeed, my lord, the countess makes no distinction among her visitors: they all are equally indifferent to her - I have attentively watched her steps, looks and motions, and discovered no foible or fancy which might be a disgrace to her delicacy and virtue. I am sorry you should harbour a suspicion against your lady, who would not have escaped the vigilance of my eye, had she made hersdf unworthy of your affection and esteem. She is innocent since I don’t think her guilty. - May I ask your lordship, whether it is from the letter you was reading when I came in, or from your own observations, that is sprung the charge against her ladyship’s fidelity.”

"From this cursed letter, Rambler."

“Very likely you know the writer of it.”

"No, it is not signed; and I am an absolute stranger to the hand.”

"And your lordship believes in an accuser, who dares not to name himself! if your lady had swerved from her duty, her favourite could not be unknown.”

"Women have an art supperior to the discernment of men - wert thou an Argus, they would find means to deceive thee. Though the countess’s lover is not known, it is not a reason to acquit her of the guilt she is charged with."

"You neither do justice to yourself, to your lady, my lord. -

“I know her better than thou dost; my doubts of her constancy are well founded - to her prudence only is she indebted for my impossibility of evidencing her perfidy - she is false, I tell thee.”

“Then, my lord, you must have other reasons than that letter to think her so.” -


“I have, I have." -

"If they are real, I do not deserve your lordship’s protection, for I swear I have no cause to impeach her ladyship’s virtue - trust, my lord to a more watchful, and sagacious servant the care of your honour."

"My reasons are of a nature thou couldst not guess; I am twenty years older than the countess - she has wants above my power of gratifying - incessently shrounded with youthful flatters, either I know not the female heart, or she must have listened to one of them - who he is, is yet a mystery - her intrigue must be favoured by her women; without their help she could not carry it on with decrecy - renew thy diligence, feign a passion for one of these women: thou makest thyself loved by her, thou wilt easily come to the knowledge of her ladyship’s amour. Bribe, seduce, swear, exert thy utmost abilities to succeed - that thou mayest serve me effectually, here are two hundred guineas in this purse: dispose of that gold when thou shall think that the offer of it may induce thy mistress into indiscretion - I rely upon thy fidelity and understanding.”

As his lordship’s madness was supperior to mortal remedies, I attempted no more to cure him of it. I took the purse and confirmed him with oaths in his expectations of me.

“Dissemble your suspicions, my lord: the countess will be less cautious and upon her guard, when she will be certain of your confidence in her.” -

“Thou art right; I will follow thy advice”.

Give me that letter, my lord: I may possibly discover who wrote it - if I do, do, we will find means to force him to prove his accusation".

"That discovery would at once put an end to my doubts, - take that letter, and act as thou thinkest proper”.

“Then I retired, overjoyed at having it in power to convince the countess of my affection”.

## LETTER VIII.

Impatient to communicate to lady C----- what I had been told by
her lord, I step’d immediately to her apartment. Her ladyship being at her toilet, I thought the moment unfavourable; and, before she had finished the important business of dressing, some ladies of the neighbourhood coming in, I had but towards the evening an opportunity of whispering in her ear, that I had a secret to disclose to her”.

“A secret! - is it very interesting?”

“I am certain your ladyship will be glad to hear it."

“Are you concerned in it?”

This question she stammered so low, and with such an accent, as clearly expressed she would not be displeased, did I answer in the affirmative.

"I am, my lady, as the discovery that secret will prove you the sincerity of my zeal".

“I want no new proof - however to-morrow morning at ten o' clock, I will wait for you in my closet”.

“At ten o’ clock in her closet”! Francis, I did not get a wink of sleep the whole night; my soul kept awake thinking how to make the best use of her ladyship’s foible in my favour. That foible had been so strongly marked in her voice and countenance, that I would have deemed it a downright insult on my understanding to doubt of its reality.

Before the wished for hour struck, lady C-----'s first woman came out of her apartment.

“Mr. Rambler, my lady has got a megrim, she will rest a few hours longer; let no body in till she rings the bell."

"Very well".

And she went away. Far from believing that megrim to be real, I thought it a pretext not to be disturbed in her conversation with me. As soon as I could unseen, steal into lady C-----'s
closet, I opened the door and bolted it. Then, fearless of danger, and full of desires, I crossed a few rooms, and entered her ladyship’s bed-chamber. From hence I was directing my steps to the place of rendezvous, when a sigh I heard made me turn to the bed; there lay the most charming woman of the age, without the dress of pride or decency — it was a summer day - how voluptuous the attitude she was in! no invidious gauze over her ivory bosom, - hardly any veil between my eye and every beauty she was endowed with. - My soul stew instantly in every vein,
and struck every particle of blood with the want of pleasure.

“The luxurious banquet is prepared for me, said I to myself; if I do not feast like a god, never shall I deserve to be entertained with another”.

After this reflection, I resolved to do honour to the generosity of my noble inviter, and to enjoy the bliss she offered. Respect, and the cursed apprehension of offending, moderated the fiery pressure of my lips. - A sigh the countess breathed, and the lively colouring of her cheeks, told me plainly I might dare - yet I durst not -

“Yes - love thee. Rambler, exclaimed the countess". -

How my heart beat! - her words proved her awake; her eyes closely shur said she was asleep. I hesitated.

"Yes - I love thee - resumed she again". -

My courage revived. I was go to confirm my triumph, when she stretched her hands, glanced her fingers her eyes, and turned to the to the other side of the bed. The fear she should awake, had at the first motion of her arm forced me to retreat behind the curtain. Then I began to think tthat the countess was really a steep. She had seemed to partake of my desire. But could not nature have, unknown to her, created those symptoms of passion? - had she only feigned to sleep would she not have continued the delusion? - This thought made me circumspect, diffident - I sat down up a chair, curling inwardly against my vanity and ill fortune.

“Lord! what a dream I have made! cried the countess, sitting upon her bed. - It is lucky it was but a dream - how imagination will rove when reason is asleep! -

Then she drew the bed curtain, and, at sight of me, expressed the greatest amazement.

Lady C----- had not the assurance to affect an anger she did not feel - forgetting the enchanting disorder of her dress, she remained before me with the looks of a woman who has rather thanks to give than reproaches to make.

“What brought you here. Rambler, stammered she with the most bewitching condusion?” -

"My good fortune.”

“What do you mean?" -

And, with a blush, she cast her eye down upon the bed.
t
“I was to hear from your own lip: that yost love me.” -

“I own. Rambler, I have dreamed of you - in that hour of forced delusion, you appeared to me the most amiable of men - I did not think of opposing the seduction, but obeyed the actual impulse, - did I speak the dream I made?”

“Twice you feelingly said, I love you Rambler.”

“It was but a dream.”

“Had I been indifferent to you, would you have dreamed of me?” -

“Have you never dreamed of those you either hate or dislike?" - "

“Do you hate me?" -

“I do not; but there are mediums between hatred and love - esteem is not tenderness.” -

“Have I inspired you with esteem only?” -

And I fixed my lips upon the hand I held.

“Sometimes I think you have not - my suffering you near me, in the situation I am in, anounces a sentiment not different from a real inclination. - It is certainly the effect of my dream - we cannot look with indifference upon the objects which have pleased us.” -

“Do not you find in your heart the sentiment you now feel for me?" -

“My heart is not yet recovered from its agitation - when it is calm, I’ll inquire into it - go, I am not well - let me alone.” -

“I will obey — but shall I lose the sight of such lovely charms without a reward?" -

“Will not you go without being bribed?" -

"Indeed I cannot." -

I approached her lips, and then -

“Rambler, I do not dream - be discreet - steal not your reward, but receive it from me.” -

“Give it then; let it be worthy of teur generosity." -

The countess smiled, and printed on my lips an animated kiss.

“Now, leave me - no - stay. What is the secret you have t- impart to me? - Is it real or fictitious?" -

“I swear by the dream you made, that it is real, and very interesting. - I will have no honour but for you - for you, adorable my lady. I’ll betray all mankind. - In vain does lord C----- rely upon my fidelity to him, my heart bids me be true to you only - you shall know the confidence he put in me yesterday." -  

"Was I the object of it?” -

"You was.” -

“We are alone; let us freely talk." -

“I'll use the liberty you give - I adore you.” -  

“Is this the secret you had to tell?” -

“No; long ago you have known it." -

"Let me then hear that to which I am yet a stranger.” -

“My tongue will talk but of love - unless you suffer me once more to breathe upon those blooming lips" -

“You grow very selfish, Rambler.” -

“Can I be generous, when you are so handsome and desirable? - Out of pity for my longing soul, deny me not.” -

“The more I give, the more you are in need - I am sorry I did not deny you a few minutes ago.” -

"You are not." -

“Presumptuous man, how do you know that?" -

"By your eyes?" -

“What do they say?" -

“The very reverse of what you spoke.” -

“You are very impertinent, Rambler." -

"You smile." -

“I have a mind not to hear your secret - I cannot thus pay for every service you will do me.” -

“An excess of liberality will not beggar you of the smallest part of your riches - they are inexhaustible you give and still possess the same power of giving." -

“For this time I will not refuse - it shall be the last.” -

“Very well.” -

“Now for the mighty Secret.”-

“Then I related to her my conversation with her lord.”

“The fool! exclaimed she when I had done. He deserves I should confirm his suspicions! I am tempted to be false since he thinks me so.” -

“It would indeed be a meritorious act." -

“You advise me to it?" -

“I sincerely do.” -

“Well, I’ll Search among my adorers for the man he fears, and that very man shall revenge me of him.” -

“Why would you be at such trouble, when nature has pointed to you your avenger in a dream?" -

“Speak no more of that dream; you are not the man he suspects, and that man only will I favour - No other could give the same poignancy to my revenge.” -

“No other should complete, what I have already begun.”

"It was but a dream." -

"Did not you praise the illusion above the reality? - I heard you when you awoke.-

"Hold your tongue." -

And she put her hand upon my lips. I leaned upon the bed, and took her in my arms.” -

“Shall I be the man?" -

"No." -

"Not the man?" -

"No." -

And she played with a lock of my hair.

“Rambler!" -

"My lady!" -

“You are very presuming - Who made you so confident?” -

“My love, and your dream.” -

“Rise - step into my dressingg room, and bring me a small white shagreen box you will find upon my toilet." -

I returned in less, than three minutes.

"Give me your hand.” -

And she put a beautiful diamond ring on my little finger.

“I bought this ring two days ago - nobody knows it for my own; so you may wear it, without danger to you or disgrace to me. I neither will be refused, nor be thanked. - Give me the letter my lord trusted to you; I may know the hand that wrote it. - March
off - my women must not find you." -

I returned, Francis, not as I came, but the most amorous of men.

## LETTER IX.

The certainty of being loved by the countess made up for my disappointment, and determined me to make the best of the first opportunity. For the loss of this I upbraided myself with “had I gallantly attempted to realise her voluntary dream. Said I to myself, she would not have awaked - I hesitated too long - her virtue put in a word, and I was deprived of happiness.”

“Some scruples arose in my breast and drew forcibly the villainy of my ingratitude to my lord: But reflecting on the inestimable value of her ladyship possession, I bid adieu to scruples, anss they returned no more.”

I had not been an hour out of my lady’s apartment, when shesSent for me. She was working at tambour, whilst one of her women read to her the Temple of Gnidus, of the celebrated Montesquieu.

“Follow me, sir."

And she trip’d to her closet.

“I know Rambler, the author of the letter Sent to my lord. 'Tis ’squire Benson, an unfortunate lover, who to revenge himself of my indifference has charged me with gallantry. Here is the last billet-doux he wrote to me.

It will convince my lord of my innocence - Say you found it in my closet, or stole it from me - I wish the ’squire may severely suffer for the mischief he intended to do - induce his lordship to chastise the fellow as he deserves.” -

“Your wish shall be gratified." -

I ravished a kiss, and went away thinking how to bring the ’squire to the punishment of the bastinado.

Hearing that his lordship had just returned from the airing he had taken, I went to him.

“What news, Rambler?" -

"The best your lordship could expect - countess is innocent, and her calumniator is known."

“Who is he?" -

"'Squire Benson." -

“Then I doubt my lady’s innocence - Benson is my friend - he would not deceive me - I cannot question his probity.” -

“That friend you think so honourable, has attempted to Seduce your wife.” -

“Have care of what you Say, Rambler - it is not upon your mere word I’ll believe Benson a rascal.” -

“Judge of him upon facts, my lord. Read this billet - it is of thesSame hand which wrote the letter you received lately, and directed to the countess.”

His lordship took the paper, and opening it with - ‘ Lord! can it be possible?” Read as follows.

To the Countess of C-----.

Throw not into despair, a man who loves you to distraction - I can no longer bear your disdains with patience - they are worse than death, or infamy. - Fear the evils I may bring upon you - lord C----- is jealous; he will easily believe any charge against you - think of the life of misery which his credulity will force you to live - of the loss of your reputation, which his behaviour will confirm - and dare to be still severe, still indifferent. - I have threatened the woman I adore! O forgive, forgive! - My heart would sooner cease to beat - I am incapable
of injuring you 0 I love — I can but love - charming C----! repay my passion, only with a smile - with a line from your hand - let me hope - I ask for no more - if I am but certain of
not being disliked, I’ll be content and happy - What is a smile - a line? -  Deny not that comfort to the disconsolate Benson.

"The villain! Exclaimed lord C----- when he had read. How he has abused my confidence and friendship! He made an absolute fool of me - it was he, Rambler, who created my suspicions against lady C-----. He observed to me, that she was courted, and often whispered to by some young men, who compose her society - by his advice I forbid the countess to admit the visit of those he pointed out to me for her favourites, and prevented her from forming connexions he did not approve of - My diffidence of her altered my temper - an offensive severity succeeded my former indulgence, and my good nature gave way to misanthropy. From this change in me, and my implicit adhesion to his counsels, he hoped, the villain! to meet with a more favourable reception from a woman exasperated against her husband - I am ashamed of the part the scoundrel has engaged me to perform. - I owe a reparation to the countess, and I will give it - She must not any more curse the hour when she became my wife. - My sole care will be to make her happy - this instant I’ll go to her, fall at her feet, and ask for the past. -

“Betray me not, my lord — I stole
f
this billet from her — let me not be mi serable for having Served you.” — : -- --

The novelty of my behaviour struck

the countess with amazement and grief. My taste for hunting, and my excursions in the country, which lasted Sometimes two or three days, made her apprehensive of my indifference. She fancied my reason had conquered over passion, and that I found in a new attachment the pleasures she had denied me. Although unwilling to favour me, she could not think of a rival without pain.

The ' part I was to perform upon the state of the polite world, flattered my pride; I was impatient to begin it, and that impatience sided for me against the charms of the countess, and the fedudions of love.

men living in Society, I Saw no meanness in the hypocrisy by the mean of
which 1 was to become great and opulent. Had the person of Mrs. Guery been as uripleasant as it was desirable. Virtue would have told me not to sacri
I
'sice her happiness to ray ambition, and
perhaps would I not have opposed her triumph; but certain that Mrs. Guery would never repent her confidence in me. Virtue was Silent, and self-interest confirmed my resolution.
■' I •
To carry this feigned amour with the looks of truth, and Secrete it from the countess, required an art I was afraid not to be master of. Mrs. Guery was often with her; at that time, could I at in character without displeasing cither of them? the countess had already

an unknown being, would men pay,

\
Rather than to give an hour of un easiness to the countess, I would have chosen to fink again in my former
station, and vegetate, all my life in a disgraceful obfeurity. I hoped her
virtue would, at last? conquer over her passion, and change it into friendship. The woman who had So often come off victorious over love and nature, could

After that Soliloquy, I refieded on
0
the authority a Sensible woman has over the passions of a young man. From a theorical knave, longing for the practical part, I had been, by degrees, forced into a delicacy of Sentiments I had not ' the idea of. Had not the virtue of the
countess been put to the test by the Severe

vere trials it had undergone, she would have had no influence over my morals — I would have attributed her virtue to my stnshilfulness, or want of a proper opportunity, and continued an unbeliever to female chastity.. My esteem commenced my reform; I blushed at the errors I had entertained, and well come at last principles I had till then

Hence it happens that a really virtuous woman is often, from the coquet try of her manner, mistaken for a voluptuary, whilst the drapery of decency ranks the voluptuary among the devotees to virtue. A husband is Seldom beforehand with the public in the Secret of his wife’s intrigues.

That levity has no influence over their morals, totally independent of the external form they think, proper to assume. None but fools will; judge of the virtue of the women from their dress, gesture and conversation: those fancy or opinion dilates, and have no other tendency than to Set off the charms they possess, and make them more conspicuoussy graceful and lovely.

pointment, and the compliments I paid
to my self-love for the happy turn I had given to my assaults against the
S virtue of Emily. I thought she believed me : I was mistaken. At the dawn of the day I was awoke by Lucy.

I got up, and stepped into a room, from whence I could, unseen, observe the motions of Emily. I had hardly
given my orders to my valet de chamber., when she came into the yard, and, after having thrown her looks every way
r
for fear of Spies, fly tiptoed to the chaise, and leapt into it. Emily had not indulged two minutes the hope

of running away from me before my

the flattering illusion.

And calling one of the Servants, he Sent him to me, whilst he threatened Lucy with my indignation for having favoured the lady’s frolicksome trick. — *

The dignity of her deportment struck my heart with remorse — fearing her virtue should force her to hate me, when not finding her mother at Lincoln, she would in me See a villain instead of a man of honour, I resolved to tell her the truth, but to colour it in a manner as to avoid her hatred, though I could not her indignation.

HEN I was by myself, I coldly refiedled on the events of the day. Though many, and of a kind the reverse of each other, they had So naturally happened, that I wondered not at the effects they had caused.

When I had fluttered a fortnight in a round of varied diversions, and studied with a philosophical diligence the Secret Springs, which gave a life to the passions of the young women of quality, I was confirmed in the judgement I had formed of them. Their jargon was at first unintelligible to me: I was

not at a little loss how to answer pertinently their questions about taste,
play,

play, dress, and the anecdotes of the day. As I had not yet lived in the
regions of folly and frivolity, I was often obliged to be silent through the fear of being either impertinent or ridiculous.

TAR from being displeased, I re joiced, Francis, at my disappointments — my heart exulted in my disgrace— — welcomed truth, and forsook my errors.
