## For beginners: Getting your bearings

Ed is a Jekyll theme. That means you will need some familiarity with Jekyll to take advantage of its full potential. While running a Jekyll is a bit more involved than Wordpress and other similar tools, the payoff in the long term is worth the effort to learn it. If you are new to Jekyll I recommend you take a look at ["How (and Why) to Generate a Static Website Using Jekyll"](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/jekyll1/60913) at ProfHacker, and the excellent [Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/) to start getting a sense of how it works. To use Jekyll you will also be using your terminal. If you need a refresher, I highly recommend "[The Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/)" 

N.B. Jekyll does not run very well on Windows machines as of now. If you are using Windows, this theme won't work for you, but we hope that you simply deploy our principles on a system like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which does work on Windows.

## For beginners: Installing Ed

The first step to install Ed is to download the source files from Github. To do so you must have git installed in your computer. You probably have git already, but if you don't, here are [some great instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to get you started. To make sure git is running on your system enter the following line on your terminal (remember to ignore the $):

~~~ bash
$ git --version
~~~

If you don't get an error, you're good to go. Using the `cd` command on your terminal, navigate to the folder where you keep your web projects. Once you're in the folder where you want Ed to live, download it from github using the following line (remember you can copy and paste):

~~~ bash
$ git clone git@github.com:elotroalex/ed.git
~~~

At this point you should navigate inside your project folder and stay there until further notice:

~~~ bash
$ cd ed
~~~

Jekyll is a Ruby gem (Ruby's name for software packages). Besides Jekyll, Ed needs another gem to run: jekyll-scholar. I have provided a Gemfile that allows you to install the right versions of jekyll and jekyll-scholar. Before you can use this Gemfile, you need to setup the right Ruby environment for Ed to run smoothly. The best way to ensure you have the right environment is to use Ruby Version Manager, or [rvm](https://rvm.io/), and the latest stable version of Ruby. To install rvm *and* a recent version of Ruby at the same time, enter the following two lines into your terminal:

~~~ bash
$ gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3

$ \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
~~~

After the process runs succesfully, read the last few lines generated by the terminal. You will see final instructions for making rvm run. Once you finish the process, check to see if rvm is running by entering:

~~~ bash
$ rvm --version
~~~

If you don't get an error, you're ready for the next step. If you do get an error, and don't feel comfortable troubleshooting on the terminal, this is a good opportunity to reach out to a friend who can help. If you're brave enough, the most effective way of troubleshooting in the terminal is to copy and paste the errors into your search engine of choice.

The next step is to create a gemset for your jekyll projects. A gemset is a set of gems. If you don't create and use a gemset, every gem you install will be applied system-wide. This may cause problems down the line, and I recommend against it. To create a gemset:

~~~ bash
$ rvm gemset create edgems
~~~

To use the gemset you just created:

~~~ bash
$ rvm gemset use edgems
~~~

N.B. Everytime you open a new tab on your terminal, you will need to declare the gemset you want to use, or else it will revert to (default).

Now that rvm and Ruby are set up, we're ready to install our first gem: Bundler. Bundler is a gem that allows you to install many gems at the same time using Gemfiles. Once you install it, you will be ready to run the Gemfile I provided in the source files. To install Bundler:

~~~ bash
$ gem install bundler
~~~

You're very close. Now that Bundler is installed the final step is to install the gems we will need to run Ed: jekyll and jekyll-scholar. To do so run the Gemfile this way:

~~~ bash
$ bundle install
~~~

If you don't get any errors, Ed should work at this point. To see if Ed is working properly we will take advantage of Jekyll's built in server. Assuming you're still inside the ed folder, you can now build the first version of your site and run the jekyll server at the same time by entering:

~~~ bash
$ jekyll serve
~~~

Copy the url on your terminal log and paste it into your browser of choice (I recommend Firefox). This url usually looks something like this `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`. At this point you should be looking at your very own working version of Ed:
