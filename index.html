<h1>Minimal editions</h1>
<p>As we see it, a minimal edition is one that reduces elements of the full stack (markup, transformation and presentation) to its bare minimum components given a set of desired functions (reading, searching, annotating, citation, extraction, versioning, etc). Out of-the-box, this theme can help you build a simple reading edition or a traditional scholarly edition with footnotes and references. In our estimate, these are the most immediately useful type of editions for editors and publics. Our hope is that our approach can help beginners or veterans deploy beautiful editions with less effort, that it can help us <a href="https://github.com/susannalles/MinimalEditions/blob/master/index.md" target="_blank" title="minimal editions syllabus">teach a 'full stack'</a> in one academic semester, allow us to care for our projects at less cost, and perhaps, just perhaps, allow us to generate high-quality editions on github.io in large quantities based on the <a href="http://jonreeve.com/2015/09/introducing-git-lit/" target="_blank" title="git-lit">git-lit</a> model by Jonathan Reeve. We're coming for you, Kindle!</p>
